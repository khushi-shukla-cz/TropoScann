# 🎯 Interactive Cyclone Risk Map - Feature Guide

## 🚀 New Interactive Features Implemented

### ✅ **Click Anywhere on Map**
- Click any location on the map to generate real-time cyclone risk data
- Dynamic values are calculated based on:
  - Geographic coordinates (lat/lng)
  - Distance from coastal areas (higher coastal risk)
  - Regional weather patterns
  - Historical cyclone activity zones

### ✅ **Real-time Data Generation**
When you click a location, the system automatically generates:
- **Risk Score** (0-100%) - Based on cyclone probability
- **Temperature** (°C) - Simulated IR satellite data
- **Cloud Coverage** (%) - Atmospheric conditions
- **Confidence Level** (%) - Model accuracy
- **Risk Level** - Low/Moderate/High classification

### ✅ **Search Functionality**
- Search bar at the top of the map
- Type any location name (city, country, landmark)
- Automatically flies to the searched location
- Generates cyclone risk data for the searched place
- Uses free OpenStreetMap geocoding (no API key needed)

### ✅ **Dynamic Dashboard Updates**
All dashboard elements update automatically when you select a new location:
- 📊 **Charts** - Historical trend data regenerated
- 📈 **Metrics** - Risk scores, temperature, coverage updated
- 🗺️ **Location List** - New locations added to monitoring
- 📍 **Current Selection** - Live status indicator with coordinates

### ✅ **Toast Notifications**
- Real-time feedback when locations are selected
- Notifications when new locations are added to monitoring
- User-friendly messages for all interactions

### ✅ **Multiple Map Styles**
Switch between 5 different map types:
1. **Interactive Map** (Default) - Full click-anywhere functionality
2. **Professional Map** - MapLibre with heatmap visualization  
3. **MapLibre GL** - Basic MapLibre implementation
4. **Leaflet Map** - Traditional Leaflet.js fallback
5. **SVG Map** - Vector-based fallback for ultimate compatibility

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. **Click Any Location**
```
1. Navigate to the Trending Patterns page
2. Ensure "Interactive Map" mode is selected
3. Click anywhere on the map
4. Watch as all values update dynamically!
```

### 2. **Search for Locations**
```
1. Use the search bar at the top of the map
2. Type: "Mumbai", "New York", "Tokyo", etc.
3. Press Enter or click the search button
4. Map flies to location and generates data
```

### 3. **View Generated Data**
```
- Risk Score: Calculated cyclone probability
- Temperature: IR satellite simulation  
- Coverage: Cloud cover percentage
- Confidence: Model accuracy level
- Coordinates: Exact lat/lng position
```

### 4. **Monitor Trends**
```
- Charts automatically update with historical trends
- Time range selector (7d/30d/90d)
- Export data as CSV files
- Compare multiple locations
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Smart Risk Calculation**
- Coastal proximity increases risk scores
- Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea = high risk zones
- Northern regions = lower cyclone probability
- Random variations simulate real-world uncertainty

### **Realistic Data Generation**
- Temperature correlates with latitude
- Coverage varies by geographic region
- Confidence levels reflect model limitations
- Risk levels auto-classify based on scores

### **Performance Optimized**
- Minimal API calls (free geocoding only)
- Efficient map rendering with MapLibre GL JS
- Lazy loading of tiles
- Smooth animations and transitions

## 🌍 Geographic Intelligence

The system recognizes and categorizes regions:
- **Northern India** - Lower cyclone risk
- **Western India** - Moderate risk (Arabian Sea proximity)
- **Eastern India** - High risk (Bay of Bengal)
- **Southern India** - Variable coastal risk
- **Central India** - Lower risk (inland)
- **Bay of Bengal** - Highest risk zone
- **Arabian Sea** - High risk zone

## 📱 User Experience Features

- **Visual Feedback** - Pulsing markers for clicked locations
- **Crosshair Cursor** - Indicates clickable map areas
- **Loading States** - Smooth transitions during data generation
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for network issues
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🚀 Try It Now!

1. Go to the **Trending Patterns** page
2. Make sure **Interactive Map** is selected
3. Click anywhere on India or surrounding areas
4. Watch the magic happen! ✨

All values will update in real-time, giving you instant cyclone risk analysis for any location you choose!
